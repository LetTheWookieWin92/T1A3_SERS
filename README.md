## Software Development Plan

### Purpose

In 2020, there were more than 4 million students enrolled in over 9,500 educational institutions in Australia (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2021). Of the many systems and processes that underpin a school's successful operation, the ability of staff to perform enrolment changes for students is of vital importance.

For each academic year, institutions will establish a list of classes that will be available for students to enrol in. Larger institutions, such as colleges or universities, may offer a wide choice of potential classes, and so when students make their selections, they can generally expect their enrolment to differ from that of their peers, even from those who are undertaking the same program.

Furthermore, institutions must often impose a limit on the number of enrolments for each class, to ensure that venues are not overcrowded and that a reasonable staff to student ratio is upheld.

Given the high volume of students and potential classes present at any large institution, a bespoke system is required to ensure staff members can perform rapid, accurate record keeping. Such a system must also carry out any necessary validation in respect of class enrolments, in order to ensure consistency and prevent potential errors.

The proposed terminal application would serve as a digital platform for staff members to read and update student enrolment profiles and class lists. Using the application, staff members would be able to look up individual students using their unique identifier, view their current enrolment, add or remove classes and identify recommended classes, based upon the studentâ€™s program. Additionally, staff members would be able to view the list of available classes and their current occupancy.

The application would provide a range of visual prompts to assist the staff member to make changes to student enrolments and would prevent them from making errors, for example over-subscribing a class, which could lead to broader problems for the institution.
